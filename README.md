# Starter code for some examples of various applications of proximal gradient

**LASSO_CoordinateDescent.R**: already coded R functions with LASSO coordinate descent algorithm. The main functions are **standardizeXY** and **fitLASSOstandardized**

**LassoProximalExamples.R**: starter functions for proximal algorithms

**TimeComparison.R** - script to compare various algorithms in terms of output and timing
